Notes from the 3/24 meeting

Next meeting: Tomorrow (Tuesday) at 7:30pm in the office

Assignments:
       - General/file/how language works - Nick
       - Flow & functions - Dave
       - Variables/hash/constraints - Josh
       - Expressions - Colin
       - Optional - Katie

Language reference must define:
       - types - int, float, string (immutable)
       - keywords
       - have a full CFG
       - scoping
       - implicit variables (me, action, participant)
       - how while works
       - how if works
       - how step works
       - logical operators and, or, not
       - arithmetic operators (precedence, what operands they take)
       - case-sensitive
       - functions
       - Environment spec
       - Participant spec
       - Simulation spec
       - hash stores number of participants, actions, step number as values
       - what the hash is
       - = returns whatever is on the left side
       - minimum output: print out state of environment and each participant
       - semantics -- e.g., me cannot be used in the environment file
       - casting -- always cast down
       - in environment file: int money where money >= 0 and money <= 1000;
       - if an assignment is invalid ()
       - comments
       - subroutines in participant files
       - for changing hash values, must use set(), which returns 0 or 1

OPTIONAL:
       - output from participant files
       - private vs. public attributes
       - arrays

Example code
-------------

environment world;

step {
       $part[0].go();
}

action hello() {
}

end {
       return num_steps == 1;
}

participant Aho

choose {
       hello();
}

Output: Aho does hello
