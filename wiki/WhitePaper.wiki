= Introduction =

The Java programming language and environment is designed to solve a number of problems in modern programming practice. Java started as a part of a larger project to develop advanced software for consumer electronics. These devices are small, reliable, portable, distributed, real-time embedded systems. When we started the project we intended to use C++, but encountered a number of problems. Initially these were just compiler technology problems, but as time passed more problems emerged that were best solved by changing the language.

~~Java: A simple, object-oriented, network-savvy, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture neutral, portable, high-performance, multithreaded, dynamic language.~~

Rumble: A simple, engaging, illustrative, and competitive language designed with children in mind. 

~~One way to characterize a system is with a set of buzzwords. We use a standard set of them in describing Java. Here's an explanation of what we mean by those buzzwords and the problems we were trying to solve.~~

== Simple ==

== Illustrative ==
  Children being introduced to programming have a big strike against them - they do not yet have an adult's capacity for abstract thought. They need a programming language that takes concrete concepts from the world they know. Rumble is designed to be as concrete as possible. It features control statements based on simple cause-and-effect scenarios that children can appreciate. Values that are assigned to attributes represent varying amounts of easily recognized qualities, such as strength and speed.

... and so on, for each buzzword.

= Summary =
~~The Java language provides a powerful addition to the tools that programmers have at their disposal. Java makes programming easier because it is object-oriented and has automatic garbage collection. In addition, because compiled Java code is architecture-neutral, Java applications are ideal for a diverse environment like the Internet.~~
